### Installation

This app __will not run on Windows__. And no support for it, ever.
I used Debian 11 (and previously 10) for a couple of years and it was pretty stable.

1. Install python3 dependencies (via pip or distro packages):
```
bs4 aiohttp cryptography
```

2. Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/dani3l0/librusik Librusik
cd Librusik
```

3. And, finally run it:
```
python3 librusik.py
```

4. Done! Librusik is now running at localhost:7777.


### Configuration

Edit `config.json` file and adjust your preferences.

Also, check localhost:7777 to manage your Librusik instance. Default user is `admin` and password is `admin` too.
