## Installation

This app __will not run on Windows__. And no support for it, ever.
I used Debian 11 (and previously 10) for a couple of years and everything was pretty fine.

__1. Install python3 dependencies (multiple ways to do it):__

- via pip:
```
pip install bs4 aiohttp cryptography
```

- or via distro packages:
```
apt install python3-bs4 python3-aiohttp python3-cryptography
```


__2. Clone the repo:__
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/dani3l0/librusik Librusik
cd Librusik
```

__3. And, finally run it:__
```
python3 librusik.py
```

__4. Done! Librusik is now running at [localhost:7777](http://localhost:7777).__

## Configuration

Edit `config.json` file and adjust your preferences.

Also, check [localhost:7777/panel](http://localhost:7777/panel) to manage your Librusik instance. Default user is `admin` and password is `admin` too.

## Some other words

Because this was my first app written in Python, code quality is quite meh. Don't expect code to be super readable and flexible.

_It just works_
